## Color Palette & Design Intent
- **Background:** #016FA0 (main) or #00769E (alternate)
- **Fish School Swoosh (bottom graphic):** #001E5A (simple fish silhouettes, static, swoosh design across bottom of page)
- **Light/Low-Contrast Accents:** #78BAAE, #0295A7
- **Text:** #FFEDBF (all main text)
- **Emphasis Accents:** #FDB36A, #FF751C, #FE3E00 (for highlights, buttons, links, etc.)

**Design Note:**
- The background should use #016FA0 or #00769E for a rich blue look.
- The fish swoosh graphic should be a static SVG of simple fish silhouettes in #001E5A, swooshing across the bottom of every page.
- Use #78BAAE and #0295A7 for subtle accents, borders, or section highlights.
- All main text should be #FFEDBF for high contrast on the blue background.
- Use #FDB36A, #FF751C, and #FE3E00 for emphasis, buttons, or important highlights.

## Notes
- Keep CSS clean and DRY (no duplicate/conflicting rules).
- Use Google Fonts: 'Nunito' for body, 'Quicksand' for headings.
- All images should be optimized for web.
- Use semantic HTML5 structure.
- Keep navigation simple and visible.
- Use flexbox for layout, avoid floats.
- Test all links and downloads.

---

## Next Steps
- Tomorrow: Rebuild from this roadmap, step by step, confirming each section visually before moving on.
- Use this file as a checklist and reference for all content, colors, and structure.

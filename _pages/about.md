# Chelsey M. Beese, Ph.D.

<img src="/images/circle_headshot.png" alt="Chelsey M. Beese headshot" style="float: left; margin-right: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; border-radius: 50%; width: 200px; height: 200px;">

**Chelsey** is a marine scientist specializing in interdisciplinary research and ecosystem modeling. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar with the [Integrated Marine Fisheries Lab](https://cheryl-barnes.github.io/integrated-marine-fisheries.html) at [Oregon State University](https://marinesciences.oregonstate.edu/), working with Dr. Cheryl Barnes (OSU) and Dr. Jon Reum (NOAA) to advance NOAA's Alaska ([ACLIM](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/alaska-climate-integrated-modeling-project)) and Gulf of Alaska ([GOACLIM](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/gulf-alaska-climate-integrated-modeling-project)) Climate Integrated Modeling projects. Her research integrates ecological modeling and climate science to explore climate impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries in the North Pacific.

She also works as a part-time research assistant for the [Marine Ecology and Ecosystem Modelling Lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Marine-Ecology-and-Ecosystem-Modelling-Lab-Alice-Rogers) under Dr. Alice Rogers at [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz).  Her current project is part of the Marsden-funded project **"Uncovering the functioning and importance of temperate mesophotic ecosystems"**, using ecosystem modeling and field data to improve understanding of these unique and understudied habitats.

Chelsey completed her Ph.D. in Marine Biology at [Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz), supervised by [Dr. Alice Rogers](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Marine-Ecology-and-Ecosystem-Modelling-Lab-Alice-Rogers) (VUW) and Professor Peter Mumby (University of Queensland). Her doctoral research focused on the effects of biogenic habitat structure loss on coral reef fish and fisheries, combining fieldwork with statistical and ecosystem modeling to understand how habitat complexity influences reef predator fitness, productivity, and fisheries.

With dual BSc degrees in Marine Science and Applied Mathematics from [Coastal Carolina University](https://www.coastal.edu), Chelsey is an expert in data analysis and algorithmic programming in R, and is the developer and maintainer of the [MizerReef R package](https://github.com/cmbeese/MizerReef). She has over a decade of teaching experience in mathematics, statistics, and biology, and more than four years of hands-on marine and estuarine fieldwork, including work as a [commercial fisheries observer](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/fisheries-observers/north-pacific-observer-program) for NOAA's North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.

Chelsey is passionate about scientific communication, community outreach, social justice, and strengthening relationships with Indigenous knowledge, people, and systems. Outside of research, she enjoys diving, travel, and a good book.

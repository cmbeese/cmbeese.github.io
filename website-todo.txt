Website To-Do List
==================

1. Add alt text to all images (gallery, icons, etc.) for accessibility.
2. Ensure the current page's navigation link is visually highlighted (add class="active" as needed).
3. Add a meta description tag in the <head> of each page for SEO.
4. Add a favicon for a professional browser tab look.
5. Create a simple 404.html page for broken links.
6. Double-check mobile usability (fonts, navigation, layout).
7. Optimize large images for web performance.
8. Make sure all social/contact links open in a new tab (target="_blank" and rel="noopener").

Notes:
- Review after next round of edits and before next deployment.
- Prioritize accessibility and mobile experience for best results.
